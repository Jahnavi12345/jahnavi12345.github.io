# *"We pay too much attention to the most confident voices - and too little attention to the most thoughtful ones. Certainty is not a sign of credibility. Speaking assertively is not a substitute for thinking deeply. It's better to learn from complex thinkers than smooth talkers."*

As I agreed a 100%, I wondered why it is so.  
Certainty is immediately visible. Deep thinking isn't. Finding the latter requires patience, observing deep thinkers over time - their history (of collected works, interactions, decisions) speaks more than their moments of fame under the spotlight. It's difficult for the world, who's too used to speed, to reward deep thinkers over those who are *only* good orators.
